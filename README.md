# Speaker identification
Simple speaker identification using the DTW (dynamic time warping) algorithm and MFCCs. This system is text-dependant. Features were exctracted from the [Speech command dataset](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/launching-speech-commands-dataset.html) from recordings containing the utterance "zero". Cross validation was performed and the result is 96 % accuracy.
To test the identification open test_identification.m.
